I am a 20 year old developer, student and open source enthusiast that loves learning.

What I am working on currently:
 
 - Doing an internship
 - Continuing development of https://github.com/JonasMuehlmann/bntp.go afterwards
 - Finishing my studies at the Bib International College (semester 5/6)
 
 - Attend <img src="https://wissensstadt.hn/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Logo_42-Heilbronn.png" width=150 height=45>

Here are a few topics I want to learn more about in the near future:

- computer graphics
- physically based rendering
- physics(optics and classical mechanics)
- high performance computing/GPGPU
- game (engine) development
- computer architecture
