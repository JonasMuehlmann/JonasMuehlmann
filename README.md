### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a 20 year old developer, student and open source enthusiast that loves learning.

What I am working on currently:
 
 - Doing an internship
 - Participating in the November Piscine at 42 Heilbronn
 - Continuing development https://github.com/JonasMuehlmann/bntp.go afterwards

Here are a few topics I want to learn more about in the near future:

- computer graphics
- physically based rendering
- physics(optics and classical mechanics)
- high performance computing/GPGPU
- game (engine) development
- computer architecture
- math
- learning
- productivity
